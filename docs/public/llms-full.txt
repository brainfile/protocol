## 1. Quick Start Guide

Quick Start

Get a task board in your project in under a minute.
  Install

``
npm install -g @brainfile/cli
`
  Initialize

`
brainfile init
`

This creates a brainfile.md file with a basic board structure.
  Use It

Option A: Interactive TUI
`
brainfile
`
Navigate with keyboard: TAB for columns, j/k for tasks, Enter to expand, q to quit.

Option B: CLI Commands
`
brainfile list                              # See all tasks
brainfile add --title "My first task"       # Add a task
brainfile move --task task-1 --column done  # Move to done
`

Option C: VSCode Extension
  Install "Brainfile" from the marketplace
  Open your project — the kanban board appears in the sidebar

---

Add AI Integration

Want your AI assistant to manage tasks directly? Add this to .mcp.json in your project:

`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brainfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brainfile/cli", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
``

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, and any MCP-compatible tool.

::: tip What can AI do with this?
Your assistant can now list tasks, create new ones, move them between columns, update priorities, and manage subtasks — all without you copy-pasting anything.

## 2. Why Brainfile?

Why Brainfile?

The Problem with Current Tools

Task management is disconnected from code.

Your tasks live in Linear, Jira, Notion, or GitHub Issues. Your code lives in git. These systems don't talk to each other in any meaningful way. You're the integration layer — copying task IDs into commit messages, manually updating status, context-switching between browser tabs.

AI assistants can't see your tasks.

Claude Code can read your entire codebase. It can see your git history, your test failures, your linter errors. But it has no idea what you're actually working on. You have to explain the task every time, paste in requirements, remind it of the acceptance criteria.

SaaS tools create dependencies.

Offline? Can't access tasks. Team changes? Export headaches. Service goes down? Work stops. Your project metadata lives on someone else's servers, in someone else's format.

---

The Brainfile Approach

Tasks as code.

A brainfile.md file in your repo. Structured YAML frontmatter that tools can parse. Human-readable markdown you can edit directly. It's data and documentation in one file.

``
---
title: My Project
columns:
  - id: todo
    tasks:
  - id: task-1
        title: Implement authentication
        priority: high
---
`

Git-native workflow.

Branch your tasks with your code. Merge them together. See task changes in your diff. Roll back if needed. Your task history is your git history.

AI-first integration.

The MCP server exposes your tasks as tools. AI assistants don't read a file — they call structured operations: list_tasks, add_task, move_task. Type-safe. Error-handled. No YAML corruption.

When to Use Brainfile

Great for:
  - Solo developers who want AI-assisted task management
  - Small teams that already use git for everything
  - Projects where tasks should live with the code
  - Developers who work offline or on planes
  - Anyone tired of context-switching between tools

Maybe not for:
  - Large organizations with complex approval workflows
  - Teams that need extensive reporting and analytics
  - Projects where non-technical stakeholders manage tasks
  - Situations requiring audit trails beyond git history

---

The Philosophy

> The protocol is the product.

Brainfile is a file format first, tools second. You can write brainfile.md` by hand with any text editor. The CLI, VSCode extension, and MCP server are conveniences built on top of a stable specification.

This means:
  - No vendor lock-in — It's just a markdown file
  - Ecosystem potential — Anyone can build tools
  - Future-proof — The format outlasts any single tool

## 3. CLI & Terminal UI

CLI & Terminal UI

The Brainfile CLI gives you full control over your task board from the terminal. Use the interactive TUI for a visual experience, or run commands for automation.

Installation

``
npm install -g @brainfile/cli
`

Verify installation:

`
brainfile --version
`

Interactive TUI

Launch an interactive kanban board in your terminal:

`
brainfile
`

Or open a specific file:

`
brainfile ./path/to/brainfile.md
`

Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| TAB / Shift+TAB | Navigate between columns |
| j / k or ↑ / ↓ | Navigate tasks |
| Enter | Expand/collapse task details |
| / | Search tasks |
| ? | Show help |
| r | Refresh |
| q | Quit |

The TUI watches your file for changes — edits from VSCode or AI assistants appear in real-time.

---

Common Commands

Initialize a New Board

`
brainfile init
`

Creates a brainfile.md with default structure: three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) and agent instructions.

List Tasks

`
brainfile list                    # All tasks
brainfile list --column todo      # Filter by column
brainfile list --tag bug          # Filter by tag
`

Add Tasks

`
brainfile add --title "Implement auth"
brainfile add --title "Fix bug" --priority high --tags "bug,urgent"
brainfile add --title "Review PR" --assignee john --due-date 2025-02-01
`

Move Tasks

`
brainfile move --task task-1 --column in-progress
brainfile move --task task-1 --column done
`

Update Tasks

`
brainfile patch --task task-1 --priority critical
brainfile patch --task task-1 --title "New title" --tags "new,tags"
brainfile patch --task task-1 --clear-assignee  # Remove assignee
`

Manage Subtasks

`
brainfile subtask --task task-1 --add "Write tests"
brainfile subtask --task task-1 --toggle task-1-1
brainfile subtask --task task-1 --delete task-1-2
`

Archive & Restore

`
brainfile archive --task task-5
brainfile restore --task task-5 --column todo
`

Validate

`
brainfile lint              # Check for issues
brainfile lint --fix        # Auto-fix issues
brainfile lint --check      # Exit with error code (for CI)
`

---

Templates

Create tasks from built-in templates:

`
brainfile template --list
brainfile template --use bug-report --title "Login fails on mobile"
brainfile template --use feature-request --title "Add dark mode"
`

Available templates:
  - bug-report — Bug tracking with triage subtasks
  - feature-request — Feature proposals
  - refactor — Code refactoring tasks

---

Shell Aliases

Add these to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

`
alias bf="brainfile"
alias bfl="brainfile list"
alias bfa="brainfile add"
alias bfm="brainfile move"
``

## 4. MCP Server Integration

MCP Server

The Brainfile CLI includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This lets AI assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, and Cline manage your tasks directly — no copy-paste, no manual updates.

Why MCP?

Without MCP, your AI assistant can read your code but doesn't know what you're working on. You have to:
  - Explain the current task every conversation
  - Copy task descriptions into prompts
  - Manually update task status after work is done

With MCP, your assistant:
  - Sees all your tasks and their status
  - Creates new tasks as work is identified
  - Moves tasks to "done" when complete
  - Updates priorities and metadata automatically

It's the difference between "update my task board" and just having it happen.

---

Setup

Add to .mcp.json in your project root:

``
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brainfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brainfile/cli", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
`

For a specific brainfile path:

`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brainfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brainfile/cli", "mcp", "-f", "path/to/brainfile.md"]
    }
  }
}
`

Restart your AI assistant to load the new server.

---

Available Tools

Your AI assistant gets access to these operations:

Task Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| list_tasks | List all tasks, filter by column or tag |
| add_task | Create a task with title, priority, tags, etc. |
| move_task | Move a task between columns |
| patch_task | Update specific fields on a task |
| delete_task | Permanently delete a task |

Archiving

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| archive_task | Move a completed task to the archive |
| restore_task | Restore an archived task to a column |

Subtasks

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| add_subtask | Add a subtask to a task |
| toggle_subtask | Mark a subtask complete/incomplete |
| update_subtask | Change a subtask's title |
| delete_subtask | Remove a subtask |

---

Example Interactions

You: "What tasks do I have in progress?"

Assistant: calls list_tasks with column filter "You have 2 tasks in progress: task-3 'Fix auth bug' and task-7 'Update documentation'."

---

You: "I finished the auth bug fix"

Assistant: calls move_task "I've moved task-3 to Done."

---

You: "Create a task for the performance issue we discussed"

Assistant: calls add_task "Created task-12 'Investigate slow dashboard load' with high priority in To Do."

---

Benefits Over Manual Updates

| Aspect | Manual | MCP |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Context switching | Open board, find task, update | Zero |
| Error risk | YAML typos possible | Type-safe operations |
| Consistency | Varies by attention | Always correct format |
| Speed | 30+ seconds | Instant |

---

Supported Assistants

The MCP server works with any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol:
  - Claude Code — Full support
  - Cursor — Full support
  - Cline — Full support
  - Other MCP clients — Should work, untested

---

Troubleshooting

Server not loading
  Check that @brainfile/cli is installed: npx @brainfile/cli --version
  Verify .mcp.json is valid JSON
  Restart your AI assistant completely
  Check assistant logs for MCP errors

Tools not appearing

Some assistants cache tool lists. Try:
  Restart the assistant
  Start a new conversation
  Explicitly ask "what brainfile tools do you have?"

Wrong file being used

Specify the file explicitly:
`
"args": ["@brainfile/cli", "mcp", "-f", "./my-project/brainfile.md"]
`

---

Manual Testing

Run the MCP server directly to test:

`
brainfile mcp
brainfile mcp --file ./project/brainfile.md
`

The server communicates via stdio — you'll see JSON-RPC messages if tools are called.

---

Alternative: Agent Hooks

If your assistant doesn't support MCP, you can install hooks that remind you to update tasks:

`
brainfile hooks install claude-code
brainfile hooks install cursor --scope project
brainfile hooks install cline
``

Hooks provide gentle reminders but don't give the assistant direct control.

## 5. VSCode Extension

VSCode Extension

The Brainfile extension brings a visual kanban board directly into VSCode. See your tasks in the sidebar, drag and drop between columns, and stay in your editor.

Installation
  Open VSCode
  Go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X / Ctrl+Shift+X)
  Search for "Brainfile"
  Click Install

Or install from the command line:

``
code --install-extension brainfile.brainfile
`

Features

Kanban Board View

The extension adds a Brainfile panel to your sidebar. Open any project with a brainfile.md file and the board appears automatically.
  - Columns — Your workflow stages (To Do, In Progress, Done)
  - Tasks — Cards showing title, priority, tags
  - Drag & Drop — Move tasks between columns visually

Real-time Sync

The extension watches your brainfile.md for changes:
  - Edit the file manually → board updates
  - AI assistant updates via MCP → board updates
  - CLI makes changes → board updates

No refresh needed. Everything stays in sync.

Task Details

Click a task to see:
  - Full description
  - Subtasks with completion status
  - Assignee and due date
  - Related files
  - Tags and priority

Quick Actions
  - Add Task — Click + in any column
  - Edit Task — Click the edit icon
  - Delete Task — Right-click menu
  - Move Task — Drag between columns

---

File Discovery

The extension looks for brainfile in this order:
  brainfile.md (preferred)
  .brainfile.md (hidden, backward compat)

If found, the kanban view activates automatically.

---

Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd+Shift+B | Toggle Brainfile panel |
| Cmd+Shift+N | New task in current column |

---

Settings

Configure via VSCode settings (Cmd+,):

`
{
  "brainfile.defaultFile": "brainfile.md",
  "brainfile.showInActivityBar": true
}
`

---

Troubleshooting

Board not showing
  Ensure brainfile.md exists in your workspace root
  Check the file is valid YAML (run brainfile lint)
  Reload the window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Reload Window")

Changes not syncing

The extension uses file watching. If changes aren't appearing:
  Save the file explicitly
  Check VSCode's file watcher isn't rate-limited
  Reload the window

Invalid YAML errors

The extension shows an error page with details when parsing fails. Run:

`
brainfile lint --fix
`

to auto-fix common issues like unquoted strings with colons.

---

Works With

The VSCode extension complements other Brainfile tools:
  - CLI — Use both interchangeably
  - MCP Server — AI updates appear in real-time
  - TUI — Terminal users see the same data

All tools read the same brainfile.md` file.

---

Source Code

The extension is open source:
  - GitHub Repository
  - Issue Tracker

---

Next Steps
  - CLI & TUI — Command-line interface
  - MCP Server — AI integration

## 6. Core Library

Core Library

@brainfile/core is the TypeScript library that powers all Brainfile tools. Use it to build custom integrations, scripts, or entirely new interfaces.

Installation

``
npm install @brainfile/core
`

Quick Example

`
import { Brainfile, addTask, moveTask } from '@brainfile/core';
import fs from 'fs';

// Parse a brainfile
const markdown = fs.readFileSync('brainfile.md', 'utf-8');
let board = Brainfile.parse(markdown);

// Add a task (immutable - returns new board)
const result = addTask(board, 'todo', {
  title: 'New feature',
  priority: 'high',
  tags: ['feature']
});

if (result.success) {
  board = result.board!;
}

// Move a task
const moveResult = moveTask(board, 'task-1', 'todo', 'in-progress', 0);
if (moveResult.success) {
  board = moveResult.board!;
}

// Save changes
const output = Brainfile.serialize(board);
fs.writeFileSync('brainfile.md', output);
`

---

Core Concepts

Immutable Operations

All board operations are immutable. They return a new board object rather than modifying the original:

`
const result = addTask(board, 'todo', { title: 'Task' });

// Original unchanged
console.log(board.columns[0].tasks.length);  // 0

// New board has the task
console.log(result.board!.columns[0].tasks.length);  // 1
`

Operation Results

Every operation returns a BoardOperationResult:

`
interface BoardOperationResult {
  success: boolean;
  board?: Board;   // New board if successful
  error?: string;  // Error message if failed
}
`

Always check success before using the result:

`
const result = moveTask(board, 'task-999', 'todo', 'done', 0);
if (!result.success) {
  console.error(result.error);  // "Task not found: task-999"
}
`

---

Board Operations

Add Task

`
import { addTask, TaskInput } from '@brainfile/core';

const input: TaskInput = {
  title: 'Implement auth',
  description: 'Add OAuth2 support',
  priority: 'high',
  tags: ['security', 'feature'],
  assignee: 'john',
  dueDate: '2025-02-01',
  subtasks: ['Research', 'Implement', 'Test']  // Creates subtasks
};

const result = addTask(board, 'todo', input);
`

Patch Task

Update specific fields. Set to null to remove:

`
import { patchTask, TaskPatch } from '@brainfile/core';

// Update fields
const result = patchTask(board, 'task-1', {
  priority: 'critical',
  tags: ['urgent']
});

// Remove fields
const removeResult = patchTask(board, 'task-1', {
  assignee: null,  // Removes assignee
  dueDate: null    // Removes due date
});
`

Move Task

`
import { moveTask } from '@brainfile/core';

// Move task-1 from todo to in-progress, at position 0
const result = moveTask(board, 'task-1', 'todo', 'in-progress', 0);
`

Delete Task

`
import { deleteTask } from '@brainfile/core';

const result = deleteTask(board, 'todo', 'task-1');
`

Archive & Restore

`
import { archiveTask, restoreTask } from '@brainfile/core';

// Archive
const archiveResult = archiveTask(board, 'done', 'task-5');

// Restore to a column
const restoreResult = restoreTask(board, 'task-5', 'todo');
`

---

Subtask Operations

`
import {
  addSubtask,
  toggleSubtask,
  updateSubtask,
  deleteSubtask
} from '@brainfile/core';

// Add subtask (ID auto-generated)
const addResult = addSubtask(board, 'task-1', 'Write tests');

// Toggle completion
const toggleResult = toggleSubtask(board, 'task-1', 'task-1-1');

// Update title
const updateResult = updateSubtask(board, 'task-1', 'task-1-1', 'New title');

// Delete
const deleteResult = deleteSubtask(board, 'task-1', 'task-1-2');
`

---

Parsing & Serialization

Parse

`
import { Brainfile, BrainfileParser } from '@brainfile/core';

// Simple parse
const board = Brainfile.parse(markdown);

// Parse with error details
const result = BrainfileParser.parseWithErrors(markdown);
if (!result.board) {
  console.error('Parse error:', result.error);
}
if (result.warnings) {
  console.warn('Warnings:', result.warnings);
}
`

Serialize

`
import { Brainfile, BrainfileSerializer } from '@brainfile/core';

// Simple serialize
const output = Brainfile.serialize(board);

// With options
const output = BrainfileSerializer.serialize(board, {
  indent: 2,
  lineWidth: 80,
  trailingNewline: true
});
`

---

Validation & Linting

`
import { Brainfile, BrainfileLinter } from '@brainfile/core';

// Validate structure
const validation = Brainfile.validate(board);
if (!validation.valid) {
  validation.errors.forEach(e => console.log(${e.path}: ${e.message}));
}

// Lint raw content
const lintResult = Brainfile.lint(content);
console.log(lintResult.issues);

// Lint with auto-fix
const fixedResult = Brainfile.lint(content, { autoFix: true });
console.log(fixedResult.fixedContent);
`

---

Templates

`
import { Brainfile } from '@brainfile/core';

// List templates
const templates = Brainfile.getBuiltInTemplates();

// Create from template
const task = Brainfile.createFromTemplate('bug-report', {
  title: 'Login fails on mobile',
  description: 'Users see error on iOS Safari'
});
`

---

Realtime Sync Utilities

For building UIs with live updates:

`
import { hashBoardContent, hashBoard, diffBoards } from '@brainfile/core';

// Hash content to detect changes
const hash = hashBoardContent(markdown);
if (hash !== lastHash) {
  // Content changed, re-parse
}

// Diff boards for incremental updates
const diff = diffBoards(oldBoard, newBoard);
if (diff.tasksMoved.length > 0) {
  // Handle moved tasks
}
`

---

TypeScript Types

`
import type {
  Board,
  Column,
  Task,
  Subtask,
  TaskInput,
  TaskPatch,
  BoardOperationResult
} from '@brainfile/core';
``

See API Reference for complete type definitions.

## 7. Protocol Specification

Protocol Specification

The Brainfile protocol defines a structured format for project tasks stored in markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

File Format

Primary File

| Filename | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| brainfile.md | 1 (preferred) | Non-hidden, visible in file browsers |
| .brainfile.md | 2 | Hidden, backward compatibility |

Archive File

Completed tasks can be moved to brainfile-archive.md.

Agent Instructions

The agent block guides AI assistant behavior:

`
agent:
  instructions:
  - Modify only the YAML frontmatter
  - Preserve all IDs
  - Keep ordering
  - Make minimal changes
  - Preserve unknown fields
  llmNotes: "Prefer functional patterns and comprehensive tests"
`

---

Rules Block

Project rules for AI and human reference:

`
rules:
  always:
  - id: 1
      rule: write tests for new features
  - id: 2
      rule: update task status as you work
  never:
  - id: 1
      rule: commit directly to main

| Type | URL |
|------|-----|
| Base | https://brainfile.md/v1/base.json |
| Board | https://brainfile.md/v1/board.json |
| Journal | https://brainfile.md/v1/journal.json |

Browse all: brainfile.md/v1/

Type Inference

When type is omitted, tools infer from:
  Schema URL pattern (/v1/journal.json → journal)
  Filename suffix (*.journal.md → journal)
  Structural analysis (columns[] → board)
  Default: board

---

ID Patterns

Task IDs

Pattern: task-N where N is a sequential number.

`
  - id: task-1
  - id: task-2
  - id: task-15
`

Subtask IDs

Pattern: task-N-M where N is parent task number, M is subtask number.

`
subtasks:
  - id: task-1-1
  - id: task-1-2
`

---

Version History

v0.4.0 (Current)
  - Added protocolVersion field
  - Added effort and blockedBy task fields
  - Added llmNotes to agent block
  - Enforced task-N ID pattern

v0.3.0
  - Changed default to non-hidden files (brainfile.md)
  - Added agent instruction block
  - Added subtasks support

---

Best Practices
  Use non-hidden files — Better visibility, AI-friendly
  Include agent instructions — Consistent AI behavior
  Preserve IDs — Never regenerate or change task IDs
  Use semantic IDs — Sequential task-1, task-2
  Keep descriptions concise — But informative
  Archive completed tasks — Keep board clean

## 8. API Reference

API Reference

Complete documentation for @brainfile/core TypeScript library.

Brainfile Class

The main class provides static methods for all core operations.

Parsing

Brainfile.parse(content: string): Board | null

Parse markdown content into a Board object.

``
const board = Brainfile.parse(markdownString);
if (board) {
  console.log(board.title);
}
`

Brainfile.parseWithErrors(content: string): ParseResult

Parse with detailed error and warning information.

`
const result = Brainfile.parseWithErrors(markdownString);
if (result.board) {
  console.log("Parsed successfully");
  if (result.warnings) {
    console.warn("Warnings:", result.warnings);
  }
} else {
  console.error("Parse error:", result.error);
}
`

Serialization

Brainfile.serialize(board: Board, options?: SerializeOptions): string

Serialize a Board object back to markdown format.

`
const markdown = Brainfile.serialize(board, {
  indent: 2,
  lineWidth: 80,
  trailingNewline: true,
});
`

Validation

Brainfile.validate(board: Board): ValidationResult

Validate a board against the schema.

`
const validation = Brainfile.validate(board);
if (!validation.valid) {
  validation.errors.forEach((err) => {
    console.log(${err.path}: ${err.message});
  });
}
`

Linting

Brainfile.lint(content: string, options?: LintOptions): LintResult

Lint raw content for issues, optionally auto-fixing.

`
// Check for issues
const result = Brainfile.lint(content);
console.log(result.issues);

// Auto-fix issues
const fixedResult = Brainfile.lint(content, { autoFix: true });
console.log(fixedResult.fixedContent);
`

Templates

Brainfile.getBuiltInTemplates(): TaskTemplate[]

Get all built-in task templates.

`
const templates = Brainfile.getBuiltInTemplates();
templates.forEach((t) => console.log(${t.id}: ${t.name}));
`

Brainfile.getTemplate(id: string): TaskTemplate | undefined

Get a specific template by ID.

Brainfile.createFromTemplate(templateId: string, values: Record<string, string>): Partial<Task>

Create a task from a template.

`
const task = Brainfile.createFromTemplate("bug-report", {
  title: "Login fails on mobile",
  description: "Users cannot log in on iOS",
});
`

Location Finding

Brainfile.findTaskLocation(content: string, taskId: string): Location

Find line number of a task in source.

Brainfile.findRuleLocation(content: string, ruleId: number, ruleType: RuleType): Location

Find line number of a rule in source.

---

Board Operations

All operations are immutable and return BoardOperationResult.

addTask(board, columnId, input): BoardOperationResult

`
import { addTask, type TaskInput } from "@brainfile/core";

const result = addTask(board, "todo", {
  title: "Implement auth",

  priority: "high",
  tags: ["security"],
  assignee: "john",
  dueDate: "2025-02-01",
  subtasks: ["Research", "Implement", "Test"],
});

if (result.success) {
  board = result.board!;
}
`

patchTask(board, taskId, patch): BoardOperationResult

Set fields to null to remove them.

`
import { patchTask } from "@brainfile/core";

// Update fields
patchTask(board, "task-1", { priority: "critical" });

// Remove fields
patchTask(board, "task-1", { assignee: null, dueDate: null });
`

moveTask(board, taskId, fromColumn, toColumn, toIndex): BoardOperationResult

## 10. Schema Types

Schema Types

Brainfile supports multiple document types, each with its own schema and optimal renderer.

Available Types

| Type | Schema | Status | Use Case |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Board | /v1/board.json | Stable | Kanban task management |
| Journal | /v1/journal.json | Stable | Time-ordered entries, dev logs |
| Collection | /v1/collection.json | Planned | Curated resource lists |
| Checklist | /v1/checklist.json | Planned | Flat ordered checklists |
| Document | /v1/document.json | Planned | Structured docs (RFCs, specs) |

---

Board (Default)

Kanban-style task boards with columns and draggable tasks.

``
---
type: board
schema: https://brainfile.md/v1/board.json
title: My Project
columns:
  - id: todo
    title: To Do
    tasks:
  - id: task-1
        title: Implement feature
        priority: high
---
`

Structure: columns[] containing tasks[]

Renderer: Kanban board with columns

View Board Schema · Example

---

Journal

Time-ordered entries with timestamps. Great for developer journals, changelogs, or status updates.

`
---
type: journal
schema: https://brainfile.md/v1/journal.json
title: Dev Journal
entries:
  - id: entry-1
    date: 2025-01-15
    title: Started authentication work
    content: |
      Researched OAuth providers.
      Decided on Auth0.
    tags: [auth, research]
---
`

Structure: entries[] with timestamps

Renderer: Timeline view

View Journal Schema · Example

---

Base Schema

All types inherit from the base schema which defines shared fields:

`
---
title: string           # Required for all types
type: string            # Optional, inferred if missing
schema: string          # Optional JSON schema URL
protocolVersion: string # Optional version string
agent:
  instructions: []
  llmNotes: string
rules:
  always: []
  never: []
  prefer: []
  context: []
---
`

View Base Schema

---

Type Inference

When type is not specified, tools determine the type by:
  Schema URL — /v1/journal.json → journal
  Filename suffix — project.journal.md → journal
  Structural analysis — columns[] → board, entries[] → journal
  Default → board

This allows files to work without explicit type declarations.

---

Schema Directory

Browse all schemas at brainfile.md/v1/

Programmatic access: GET https://brainfile.md/v1/index.json

`
{
  "schemas": {
    "base": { "url": "https://brainfile.md/v1/base.json" },
    "board": { "url": "https://brainfile.md/v1/board.json" },
    "journal": { "url": "https://brainfile.md/v1/journal.json" }
  }
}
`

---

Custom Types

You can create custom types by:
  Extending the base schema
  Hosting your schema at a URL
  Referencing it in your brainfile

`
---
type: sprint-board
schema: https://mycompany.com/schemas/sprint-board.json
title: Sprint 42
---
`

Tools that don't recognize the custom type will fall back to generic tree rendering.

---

Renderer Hints

Schemas can include x-brainfile-* hints for optimal display:

`
{
  "x-brainfile-renderer": "kanban",
  "x-brainfile-items-path": "columns[].tasks[]"
}
``

This helps generic tools render unknown types appropriately.

## 11. Complete Example

Full example from protocol/example/brainfile.md:

```yaml

# LEGACY EXAMPLE: This file demonstrates backward compatibility
# Notice: NO "type" field - older brainfiles work without explicit type
# The system will infer type: board based on presence of "columns" field

# Title of the board (required)

# Schema URL pointing to legacy v1 schema (before type-specific schemas)
schema: https://brainfile.md/v1

# Agent instructions - how AI should interact with this board
agent:
  instructions:

# Rules system - guidelines for working with this board
rules:
  # Rules that must always be followed
  always:
    - id: 1
