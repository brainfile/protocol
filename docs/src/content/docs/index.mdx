## What is Brainfile?

Brainfile is a **protocol-first task management system** that uses a simple YAML-based format in `brainfile.md` files. It's designed for AI-assisted development, enabling both humans and AI agents to understand and modify project tasks seamlessly.

## Core Philosophy

**Protocol First**: The schema is the product. Tools and integrations are built around a single, well-defined protocol.

**AI Native**: Built from day one for AI agents. Explicit instructions, structured data, and clear semantics ensure consistent behavior across different AI systems.

**File Based**: Tasks live in markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Version control friendly. No databases. No lock-in.

## Key Features

- **Simple Format** - YAML frontmatter + Markdown content
- **AI Compatible** - Explicit agent instructions and schema validation
- **Visual Tools** - VSCode extension with kanban board UI
- **CLI Interface** - Powerful command-line tools for automation
- **Template System** - Built-in templates for bugs, features, and refactoring
- **Version Control** - Text-based format works perfectly with Git

## Schema URL

Use this in your `brainfile.md` files:

```yaml
schema: https://brainfile.md/v1
```

## Quick Example

```yaml
---
schema: https://brainfile.md/v1
title: My Project
agent:
  instructions:
    - Modify only the YAML frontmatter
    - Preserve all IDs
columns:
  - id: todo
    title: To Do
    tasks:
      - id: task-1
        title: Implement user authentication
        priority: high
        tags: [backend, security]

## Why Brainfile?

**For Developers**: Keep tasks alongside your code. No context switching between tools.

**For AI Agents**: Structured format with explicit instructions ensures consistent, predictable behavior.

**For Teams**: Version controlled tasks mean full history, easy collaboration, and no vendor lock-in.

**For Projects**: Start simple with a single file. Scale to complex workflows with templates and automation.
